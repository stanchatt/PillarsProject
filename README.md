This game will use a turn based combat system using a 4X grid map layout. Turn order will be decided by a speed stat and attacking enemies will do damage based on your weapons stats and the opponents armour value. reducing an enemies health to zero will defeat them and reward the player with gold they can spend.

## 4.Structure

##### 4.1 Quests
In terms of Quests, this game will include educational tasks that will be teaching the player how to play the game at the very beginning of the play through. To then advancing onto the next stages being actual resource rewards per task to build up the main village and quests such as defending Pillar against the various attacks. 

##### 4.2 Rewards
After completing a quest, the player will be granted extra gold to spend on various village or Pillar upgrades. The rewards are directly correlated to the Quests as with each completed set of tasks, the village will grow in wealth and size, providing more gold inflow into the town. As the hero completes quests, more godly powers will be given to the character which recruits more soldiers/villagers to the town. 
	
##### 4.3 Front End
The player moves with the mouse and by holding right-click, the player can move the camera within the top-down Warcraft-like world where you can see what is ahead of the pillar/village to spot any attacks or potential resource fountains. 

The game will operate on a hexagon field with each town building type i.e. inn, residence, barn and etc. residing within their own hexagon. The quest status bar will always be on the player's screen to remind them of the task that needs to be done for progression. Completed tasks will be matched with a tick and the incomplete ones will remain on the screen.
##### 4.4 Player Hub
The main player hub could look something like this:
		
Pillars


[Play]
[Save/Load]
[Options]
[Exit]

From here, the player can navigate to the options screen to tweak some settings before heading into the game or save or load a previous game that is being completed. 


After the [Play] button has been pressed, the game will then prompt "Easy, Medium and Hard difficulties". Depending on the choice, the game states of the game change as with harder difficulties, the resource gain will be slowed down and the chances of an unexpected attack almost double, making survival more difficult.
## 5. Audio

##### 5.1 Sound Effects
The Sound effects in the game will include but not be limited to:
attacking sound (sword and shield)
attacking sound (Bow and Arrow)
status sound (affected by poison)
status sound (affected by a stun)
Confirm sound for actions 
saving noise to confirm a successful saved game

## 6. Target Audience and Financing 

##### 6.1 Target Audience
The age of the audience in mind for Pillars will mostly be adults under the age of 30. They are likely already PC gamers and will probably have a pre-established interest in the turn-based strategy genre as well as an interest in traditional western-developed RPGs. They are likely fans of the popular strategy series Civilization and have probably ventured onto other games in the genre such as Endless Legend. We may also be able to appeal to those who are interested in indie games as a whole.

##### 6.2 Projections, Legal Fees And ROI
Pillars will require a £150,000 investment for a one year development cycle.

The money will be split as follows:

- £105,000 - for the studio's five employees.

- £20,000 - for marketing and branding.

- £5,000 - for equipment and appropriate software.

- £1,000 - for self-publishing, trademarks, legal fees and a maintaining a website.

- £19,000 - for back-up, extra costs and security.

The game will be sold on Steam and itch.io for _£7.99_.

Steam takes 30% of all sales, meaning to break-even we will need to sell 24,506 copies. For itch.io, who take 10% of all sales, we'd need to sell 20,651 copies to break-even.

Ideally we'd like to reach 100,000 sales in one year, with at least 50,000 of those being at full price. Presuming we were able to do that, with 50,000 sales being at the full price of £7.99 and the other 50,000 being at a discounted price of £4.99, we'd make a raw profit of £649,000 and a gross profit (if all sales were on Steam) of £454,300.

On each sale, the investor will receive 20% of their investment meaning it'll take 93,750 sales for the investor to be fully reimbursed for their investment, making ~ £1.60 per sale.
